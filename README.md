## Assignment Specification
Develop a small project using a RESTful API of your own choice. 
You may combine two or more APIs if you need to.
*The only minimum requirement is to demonstrate usage at least 5 different API requests*

[See Starter Code Here](https://github.com/Web-Advanced-Spring-2017/wiki/tree/master/starter-code)

Some of the APIs to look into:
* [The Big List of Public APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
* [Another 300 public APIs](https://any-api.com/)

You may use this as your golden source to dive deeper into publically available services that you can utilize for your upcoming projects.
